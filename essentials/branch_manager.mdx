title: 'Branch Manager'
description: '`BranchManagerWrapper` is designed to help you manage multiple branches of embedding vectors, allowing for the creation of new branches, switching between branches, or merging them.'
---

Use it like:
```python branch_manager.py
from incribo import BranchManagerWrapper

# Create a new branch manager
bm = BranchManagerWrapper([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])

print(f"Initial vector: {bm.get_active_vector()}")
print(f"Initial branch count: {bm.get_branch_count()}")

# Create a new branch
new_branch = bm.create_branch([4.0, 5.0, 6.0])
print(f"New branch index: {new_branch}")
print(f"Active vector after new branch: {bm.get_active_vector()}")

# Switch back to the main branch
bm.switch_branch(0)
print(f"Active vector after switch: {bm.get_active_vector()}")

# Create another branch
bm.create_branch([7.0, 8.0, 9.0])

# Merge the two new branches
bm.merge_branches(1, 2)
print(f"Active vector after merge: {bm.get_active_vector()}")
print(f"Total branches: {bm.get_branch_count()}")

# Try to switch to a non-existent branch
try:
    bm.switch_branch(10)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error switching branch: {e}")
```
`BranchManagerWrapper` maintains a memory-based list of all branches, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of any branch. <br />
The merging functionality provides a simple way to combine different branches, 
though in practice you might want to combine this component with a more sophisticated merging strategy depending on your specific use case.

**tl;dr** of `BranchManagerWrapper`:

- Experimenting with different variations of an embedding vector
- Maintaining separate embeddings for different contexts or tasks
- Implementing a collaborative system where different users can work on various branches
- Design a **multi-agent system** based off various branches

**Note** that the `switch_branch()` and `merge_branches()` methods return **PyResults**, 
which means they can potentially raise exceptions if you try to access non-existent branches.
