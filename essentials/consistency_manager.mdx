title: 'Consistency Manager'
description: '`ConsistencyManagerWrapper` is designed to manage consistent access to an embedding vector across multiple threads or processes, ensuring that updates are atomic and providing versioning.'
---

An example usage would be:
```python consistency_manager.py
from incribo import ConsistencyManagerWrapper
import threading

# Create a new consistency manager
manager = ConsistencyManagerWrapper([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])

# Function to update the vector in a thread
def update_vector():
    global manager
    new_version = manager.update([4.0, 5.0, 6.0])
    print(f"Updated to version: {new_version}")

# Function to read the vector in a thread
def read_vector():
    global manager
    vector = manager.get_vector()
    version = manager.get_version()
    print(f"Read vector: {vector}, version: {version}")

# Create and start multiple threads
update_thread = threading.Thread(target=update_vector)
read_thread = threading.Thread(target=read_vector)

update_thread.start()
read_thread.start()

update_thread.join()
read_thread.join()

# Final state
final_vector = manager.get_vector()
final_version = manager.get_version()
print(f"Final state - Vector: {final_vector}, Version: {final_version}")
```
`ConsistencyManagerWrapper` aims to provide a thread-safe access to an embedding, ensuring consistency when reading and updating the vector in a multi-threaded environment.

**tl;dr** of `ConsistencyManagerWrapper`:

- Maintaining a shared embedding vector in a multi-threaded application,
- Implementing a versioning system for embeddings that are updated over time,
- Ensuring atomic updates to an embedding vector in a concurrent environment.

**Note** that the `update()` and `get_vector()` methods return **PyResult**, which means they can potentially raise exceptions
 (e.g., if a lock can't be acquired within a timeout period).
