title: 'Update Counter'
description: '`UpdateCounterWrapper` is designed to keep track of the number of updates or changes that have occurred to your embeddings.'
---


To use this:
```python update_counter.py
from incribo import UpdateCounterWrapper

# Create a new update counter
counter = UpdateCounterWrapper()

# Check the initial count
initial_count = counter.get_count()
print(f"Initial count: {initial_count}")  # Output: Initial count: 0

# Increment the counter a few times
for _ in range(5):
    counter.increment()

# Check the updated count
updated_count = counter.get_count()
print(f"Updated count: {updated_count}")  # Output: Updated count: 5

# Increment more and check again
counter.increment()
counter.increment()
final_count = counter.get_count()
print(f"Final count: {final_count}")  # Output: Final count: 7
```
This component is useful in scenarios where you need to keep a track of the times something has been modified or updated. 

Some potential use cases include:<br/>
- Tracking the number of times an embedding has been updated, or <br />
- Counting the number of iterations in an algorithm, or <br />
- Monitoring the frequency of certain events or operations.

`UpdateCounterWrapper` does not have an upper limit, and will continue tracking update counts as long as needed with the underlying data changes.
