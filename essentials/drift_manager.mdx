title: 'Drift Manager'
description: '`DriftManagerWrapper` helps to monitor and detect significant changes **(drift)** in embedding vectors over time, with the ability to compare current embeddings to an original reference embedding.'
---

An example usage would be:
```python drift_manager.py
from incribo import DriftManagerWrapper

# Create a new drift manager with an initial vector and threshold
drift_manager = DriftManagerWrapper([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)

# Check drift with a similar vector (should return False)
slight_change = drift_manager.check_drift([1.1, 2.1, 3.1])
print(f"Slight change causes drift: {slight_change}")  # Output: False

# Check drift with a more different vector (might return True)
big_change = drift_manager.check_drift([2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
print(f"Big change causes drift: {big_change}")  # Output: True

# Update the drift threshold
drift_manager.update_threshold(1.0)

# Check drift again with the new threshold
big_change_new_threshold = drift_manager.check_drift([2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
print(f"Big change causes drift with new threshold: {big_change_new_threshold}")  # Output: False

# Get the original vector
original = drift_manager.get_original_vector()
print(f"Original vector: {original}")  # Output: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
```
The `check_drift()` method calculates the **Euclidean distance** between the current vector and the reference vector.

**tl;dr** of `DriftManagerWrapper`:

- Detecting when a model's predictions are starting to deviate significantly from its initial state, <br />
- Identifying when retraining might be necessary due to data distribution shifts, <br />
- Monitoring the stability of embeddings in a production environment.
