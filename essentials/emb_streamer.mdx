title: 'Embedding Streamer'
description: '`EmbeddingStreamer` is designed to handle streaming data from various sources (like local files or databases), convert this data into embeddings on-the-fly, and manage these embeddings dynamically.'
---
Usage:
```python embedding.py
import numpy as np
from incribo import EmbeddingStreamer

# Define a simple embedding function (in practice, this would be more complex)
def simple_embedding(text):
    return np.array([len(text)], dtype=np.float32)

# Create a new EmbeddingStreamer
streamer = EmbeddingStreamer(simple_embedding)

# Stream from a local file
streamer.stream_local_file("path/to/your/file.txt")

# Stream from a database
streamer.stream_database("postgresql://username:password@localhost/dbname", "SELECT text FROM documents")

# Update an embedding
streamer.update_embedding("doc1", "New document text", 0.1)

# Retrieve an embedding
embedding = streamer.get_embedding("doc1")
if embedding:
    print(f"Embedding for doc1: {embedding}")
else:
    print("No embedding found for doc1")
```
`EmbeddingStreamer` handles the complexities of data streaming, embedding creation, and storage, allowing you to focus on defining the embedding function and using the results. 
<br />It's particularly useful for scenarios where data is constantly changing or arriving in real-time, and you need to maintain up-to-date embeddings.

**tl;dr** of `EmbeddingStreamer` :

 - Processing large datasets that don't fit in memory,
 - Creating embeddings from continuously updating data sources,
 - Implementing online learning systems where embeddings are updated as new data arrives.
