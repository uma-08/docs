title: 'Dynamic Embeddings'
description: '`DynamicEmbeddingWrapper` is designed to handle dynamic data with your embeddings that can be updated over time.'

Let's look at an example of how this could be used:
```python dynamic_embeddings.py
from incribo import DynamicEmbeddingWrapper

# Create or add your existing embeddings
emb = DynamicEmbeddingWrapper([0.4140090346336365, 0.7410697340965271,  
0.9770076274871826, 0.04037611931562424, 0.1512177288532257])

# Get the current vector
current_vector = emb.get_vector()
print(current_vector)  # Output: [0.414009034, 0.7410...]

# Update the embedding
emb.update([4.0, 5.0, 6.0])

# Get the updated vector
updated_vector = emb.get_vector()
print(updated_vector)  # Output: [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]
```
In the example above, we perform function calls of creating a new embedding using `DynamicEmbeddingWrapper`
which stores the vector(or "state") in memory.

When the underlying data changes, we can auto-update the embeddings using the `update()` method to change the state of your vectors.

**NOTE:** This method does not delete or erase your previous embeddings(more on state fallbacks in [VersionControlWrapper](https://google.com)).
  
This component does not perform any computations on the embeddings itself - **instead**, it acts as a container that facilitates the storage and updating of embedding vectors. 
<br />The actual computation of new embeddings would typically be done externally, and then the results can be stored in this wrapper.
