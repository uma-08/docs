<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the python package">
    Setup your virtual environment and run this code:
```
pipx install incribo
```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create stateful embeddings">
   Import the package and add your existing embeddings:
```python embedding.py
from incribo import Embedding

# Create a new embedding
emb = Embedding([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], "bert-base-uncased")

# Get the vector
vector = emb.get_vector()
print(f"Embedding vector: {vector}")

# Get the model name
model = emb.get_model()
print(f"Model: {model}")

# print the Embedding object 
print(emb)
```
